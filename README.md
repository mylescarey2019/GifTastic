Gif Retrieval Web Page

## Description
 
This page retrieves Gif using the Gihpy API.  The user enters a search term such as 'cats'
and 10 Gifs will be loaded into a carousel display.  

Search terms are saved in a dropdown list and local storage for device persistance.
A clear button allows all saved searches to be removed.

The current Gif search is highlighted in the dropdown list and is remembered on page reload.

There is a modal form with instructions that displays if the page finds no saved searches 
in local storage on page load.

This page was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap and the Giphy API.
